abstract={A gamma ray detector for PET, consisting of an array of mixed
lutetium oxyorthosilicate (MLS) scintillator crystals coupled to a
position sensitive avalanche photodiode (PSAPD), was evaluated. The
scintillator array was constructed from individual MLS crystals with
dimensions of 1.5 mm times;1.5 mm times;15 mm. The assembled 7 times;7
array, including inter-crystal reflector material, had a pitch of 1.79
mm. The low noise, high gain PSAPD had dimensions of 14 mm times;14 mm.
Peaks associated with each of the 49 scintillator crystals were readily
identifiable in flood histograms, and most of the crystals demonstrated
energy resolution in the range of 15% to 20% at 511 keV. Preliminary
measurements of the timing of the PSAPD in coincidence with a
fast-scintillator/PMT detector indicated a timing resolution of
approximately 4 ns. The operating characteristics and design attributes,
such as compactness and reduced readout channel requirements, of the
PSAPD make it attractive for high resolution PET applications.},

properties were investigated and compared to the results obtained for
the binary compositions. Small samples, few millimeters in size, were
tested. Under X-ray excitation each crystal exhibits bright green
emission in the 425 to 750 nm spectral range. The exact peak position
depends slightly on the material composition. The emission is due to d-f
transitions on the Ce^3+ ion. The scintillation under gamma excitation
is fast and decays with about 30 ns time constant. The rise time varies
slightly and it can be as fast as 0.5 ns. The light output of the
investigated samples varied from 115,000plusmn13,000 ph/MeV for LuI_3 to
68,000plusmn8,000 ph/MeV for LuI_3 -YI_3 composition. The energy
resolution at 662 keV was difficult to estimate since the samples lacked
in crystal quality. LuI_3 -GdI_3 composition was also tested for the
detection of thermal neutrons from a moderated ^252 Cf source. The
neutron peak appears at 81 keV when compared to 60 keV peak in ^241 Am

adequate results: It produced a clear thermal neutron peak, a difference
in time profiles under gamma and neutron excitation was observed, and
pulse shape discrimination (PSD) based on two integration windows and
their ratios was achieved. The PSD provided an excellent separation
between gamma and neutron events. The discrimination ratio was better
than 1:1000 (based on 15,000 events). We have also tested a relatively
smaller sample with excellent crystal quality for the energy resolution.
The results surpassed those previously obtained. The recorded energy

abstract={For several decades most of the efforts to develop new
scintillator materials have concentrated on high-light-yield inorganic
single-crystals while polycrystalline ceramic scintillators, since their
inception in the early 1980's, have received relatively little
attention. Nevertheless, transparent ceramics offer a promising approach
to the fabrication of relatively inexpensive scintillators via a simple
mechanical compaction and annealing process that eliminates
single-crystal growth. Until recently, commonly accepted concepts
restricted the polycrystalline ceramic approach to materials exhibiting
a cubic crystal structure. Here, we report our results on the
development of two novel ceramic scintillators based on the non-cubic
crystalline materials: Lu_2 SiO_5 :Ce (LSO:Ce) and LaBr_3 :Ce. While no
evidence for texturing has been found in their ceramic microstructures,
our LSO:Ce ceramics exhibit a surprisingly high level of
transparency/translucency and very good scintillation characteristics.
The LSO:Ce ceramic scintillation reaches a light yield level of about
86% of that of a good LSO:Ce single crystal, and its decay time is even
faster than in single crystals. Research on LaBr:Ce shows that
translucent ceramics of the high-light-yield rare-earth halides can also
be synthesized. Our LaBr_3 :Ce ceramics have light yields above 42000
photons/MeV (i.e., gt;70%of the single-crystal light yield).},

abstract={The observed discrepancy in the light output, measured for a
number of LSO, LYSO and BGO scintillators by different photomultipliers
(PMTs), triggered studies to understand the problem. For that purpose
the photoelectron number was measured by two different methods: the
direct one based on a comparison of the full energy peak to that of the
single photoelectron and by a method based on the pulse height
resolution of the peak due to the light pulser. In this study, a
significant number of different PMTs from Photonis and Hamamatsu were
used. We concluded that the number of photoelectrons measured by means
of the direct method was higher than the number of photoelectrons
calculated from the pulse height resolution of the light pulser peak for
all of the PMTs but XP2020Q. It leads to a large dispersion in the
estimated light output for a given scintillator. In detail, the light
output of BGO and LSO determined with the R6231 and R2059 PMTs is
comparable to those measured with XP2020Q PMT and the S3590-18 pin
photodiode, when photoelectron number is calculated from the pulse
height resolution. Further in-depth studies of the photoelectron number
at different bias voltages suggested that the effect is related to the
space charge created in the dynode structure of the PMTs. Operation of
PMTs at lower bias/gain minimizes this effect; thus, low noise
electronics are recommended to determine the single photoelectron peak
under these conditions. Moreover, the absolute light output of
scintillators is affected by differences in the quantum efficiency
calibrations by Photonis and Hamamatsu.},

abstract={The recent development of fast scintillating crystals with

to incorporate time-of-flight information into whole-body positron
emission tomography scanners (TOF-PET). The development of fast
scintillators has continued, and scintillators such as CeBr_3 and the
six crystals we report on here are candidates for future TOF-PET
scanners. We have performed preliminary tests on six prototype
scintillating crystals composed of YI_3 (2% Ce), (Lu,Gd)I_3 (2% Ce),
Lul_3 (10% Ce), Lul_3 (5% Ce), Lul_3 (2% Ce), and Ce(Br,Cl)_3 . The
crystals were coupled to a PMT to observe 511 keV photons produced by
positron captures in a ^22 Na point source. A LaBr_3 coincidence
detector was used in order to make timing resolution measurements. The
prototype samples had a range of timing resolutions from 160 ps to 250
ps (FWHM). Ce(Br,Cl)_3 was found to have the best timing resolution,
with 160 ps, followed by Lul_3 (2% Ce) with 180 ps. These results are
competitive with the 160 ps we observed for a pair of LaBr_3 crystals in
coincidence with each other. The 2% Ce doped Lul_3 sample was found to
have the best overall energy response, with an energy resolution (FWHM)
of 6% at 511 keV. Energy resolution and light yield measurements are
presented for each of the crystals.},

proportionality, high up to 100,000 photons/MeV light yield, and very
good energy resolution, as low as 2.8% at 662 keV. Yet, one of the
issues facing these materials is radiation trapping. Radiation trapping
results from a small Stokes shift that creates considerable overlap
between emission and absorption bands. As a result the scintillation
light is absorbed and emitted multiple times, leading to a prolongation
of the scintillation decay, potential light losses and degradation of
energy resolution. Spectroscopic properties of various Eu^2+ doped
alkaline earth halides are presented. Materials studied include: SrI_2 ,
BaI_2 , BaBrI and other compounds. It appears that some compositions are

studied crystals nominally doped with 0.5%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%Ce (by

is a decrease in light output and little or no change in decay time
constants. These results show that the light output does not change with
Ce concentration up to 30% and depends mostly on the crystal quality. On
the other hand we have found the timing properties to be a strong
function of Ce concentration. As the Ce content increases, the principal
decay time constant of scintillation decreases from sim;26 ns for 0.5%Ce
to sim;17 ns for crystals with >5% Ce. Moreover, there is a significant
change in rise time constants. The rise time measured for a sample doped
with 0.5%Ce is up to 9 ns, whereas for samples doped with >10% Ce it is
less than 0.5 ns. The change of rise time has a major effect on the
timing properties of this scintillator, with timing resolution improving
from 361 ps to less than 100 ps (full width at half maximum).},

abstract={A growing interest in detection of neutron radiation in
scientific and security applications stimulates work on new neutron
scintillators and detection systems. This includes one of the most
interesting materials that has been recently discovered for thermal
neutron detection - Cs_2 LiYCl_6 :Ce (CLYC). This material exhibits
excellent scintillation properties for thermal neutron detection
including gamma-neutron discrimination. It can also be successfully used
for a gamma ray spectroscopy due to its excellent energy resolution
(5.1% fwhm at 662 kV). In this paper we present a system designed and
built to work with CLYC for neutron and gamma ray detection. The system
accepts signals directly from a photomultiplier and in turn provides
signals that can be fed to any MCA. Using pulse height and pulse shape
discrimination it distinguishes these two types of radiation on the fly.
The system works in the gamma energy range of 0 to approximately 4 MeV
with discrimination. A variable range is also possible by changing the
gain on a photomultiplier (no discrimination, for gamma ray
spectroscopy).},

abstract={In this paper we report on our investigation of the CeBr_3
timing properties for Time-of-Flight (TOF) Positron Emission Tomography
(PET). The TOF detection can significantly improve the signal-to-noise
ratio in a reconstructed PET image and reduce the number of events
necessary to do the reconstruction. In order to achieve TOF PET, a
scintillator must have good timing resolution and good light output. We
have investigated seven CeBr_3 samples of different height, ranging from
3 mm to 37 mm. Two Hamamatsu R4998 fast photomultipliers were used for
most experiments. Each sample was measured against a common standard
(LaBr_3 :5%Ce) and the average timing resolution was found to be about
166 ps (fwhm). The two reference (LaBr_3 :5%Ce) crystals measured
against each other gave the timing resolution of 170 ps. The best time
resolution of 108 ps (fwhm) was measured for two CeBr_3 samples (3 and
12 mm height). The longest sample (37 mm) provided 215 ps (fwhm). Two
such samples working in coincidence would give about 252 ps timing
resolution (fwhm, calculated). We have also measured TOF, where the
source was moved between the two detectors and the change in a timing
peak position was registered. The results show that a shift of 5 cm
could be easily resolved by such a system.},

abstract={The observed discrepancy in the scintillator light output,
measured by different PMTs, triggered studies to understand the problem.
In that purpose the photoelectrons number were measured by two different
methods: the classical one based on comparison of the full energy peak
to that of single photoelectron and by a method based on the pulse
height resolution of the peak due to the light pulser. Under the test
significant number of different PMTs from Photonis and Hamamatsu were
used. We concluded that the number of phe obtain by means of classical
method was higher than the number of phe calculated from the pulse
height resolution of the light pulser peak for all of the PMTs but
XP2020Q. It leads to large dispersion in the estimated light output for
a given scintillator. In details, the light output of BGO and LSO
determined with R6231 and R2095 is comparable to those measured with
XP2020Q and S3590-18 pin photodiode, when photoelectron number
calculated from the pulse height resolution is used. Further carried on
in-depth studies of the photoelectron number at different HV suggested
that the effect is related to the space charge created over the dynode
structure of PMTs. Operation of PMTs at lower HV/gain minimizes this
effect, thus low noise electronics is recommended to get the single
photoelectron peak at this conditions. Moreover, the absolute light
output of scintillators is affected by differences in the quantum
efficiency calibration at Photonis and Hamamatsu.},

abstract={Gamma-ray signatures are generally used for detecting nuclear
materials. It is difficult to distinguish gammas from backgrounds and
innocent radiological materials, which can result in high false alarm
rate. Dual neutron-gamma detectors for detecting illegally trafficked
nuclear materials have a potential to reduce the false alarm rate.
Elpasolite scintillator Cs_2 LiYCl_6 (CLYC) doped with Ce^3+ presented
in this work can detect both neutrons and gammas efficiently. In this
work we will discuss results to show the ability of CLYC to detect
thermal neutrons efficiently with very high gamma discrimination rate.
Excellent energy resolution that can be obtained with CLYC is as good as
3.9 % for 662 keV (FWHM). On the other hand, the presence of ^6 Li which
has an acceptable cross-section for thermal neutron capture, allows this
material to detect thermal neutrons as well. In the energy spectrum, the
full energy thermal neutron peak typically appears above 3 MeV
gamma-equivalent energy (GEE). Thus very effective pulse height
discrimination (PHD) can be implemented with these materials by
rejecting gamma-ray events below 3 MeV. Apart from PHD, using
pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) it is also possible to separate neutron
and gamma events. Preliminary measurements using NIM modules were
performed, the method frequently used for organic scintillators to
estimate the gamma rejection ratio (GRR). Moreover, we have also tested
this scintillator with Si-based optical sensors, such as avalanche photo
diodes (APD), and solid state photo multipliers (SSPM). The results
clearly show that CLYC can be used for thermal neutron detection with
these devices. This gives the opportunity for developing efficient,
compact, and low-cost radiation detectors that can be deployed in large
numbers.},
