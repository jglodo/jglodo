I am a physicist with background in radiation detection, material development, and basic software development.  Beside science I am interested in finance and business development.  

I hold a director's position at Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. working on development of novel scintillating materials and scintillator based detectors/detection systems.  

Over the years, I managed multiple research projects from DOE, NIH, DHS, and DOD. 

I am looking for opportunies for collaborations related to material development and their commercial applications.
